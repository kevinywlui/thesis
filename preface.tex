I've have written this thesis with some accessibility in mind. In particular,
my goal was to write a thesis assessable to myself as a second graduate
student. I will assume the reader has taken a graduate level algebra sequence
and have had some exposure to complex abelian varieties and modular forms. For
learning about complex abelian varieties, I recommend the article of Rosen
in~\cite{mr89b:14029}, and for learning modular forms, I recommend the
combination of the books by Stein~\cite{stein:modform} and, Diamond and
Shurman~\cite{diamond-shurman}.

After reading the introduction, an interested expert can skip to
Chapters~\ref{chap:totally_split} and~\ref{chap:isogeny_class}, and
back-reference as needed.

Chapter~\ref{chap:algorithms} has been largely taken from the source code of
\sage~\cite{sage} and a forthcoming paper by Hao Chen, myself, and William Stein. For the
most part, the algorithms were created and implemented into \sage and \magma~by
William Stein. This chapter is included in this thesis so I am not relying on
currently unpublished work.

The code used to generate the data of this thesis was done in \sage~\cite{sage}
will be available here~\url{kevinlui.org/thesis}.

\abstract{%
In this thesis, we aim to give algorithms for computing two key invariants of
the modular Jacobians $J_0(N)$.

We first give methods for computing the rational torsion order of rank-0
Jacobians $J_0(N)$ that are isogenous to a product of elliptic curves. We call
these the rank-0 totally split Jacobians. The rational torsion is an important
invariant of the Generalized BSD conjecture so being able to compute the
rational torsion order will provide evidence towards this conjecture. We will
provably enumerate the set of totally split $J_0(N)$, give an algorithm for
computing the rational torsion subgroup, and later give techniques for
computing the rational torsion order for rank-0 totally split Jacobians
$J_0(N)$. 

Next we will give an algorithm for computing the rational odd-isogeny class of
a simple abelian subvariety $A$ of $J_0(N)$ for prime $N$, under mild
conditions. This is done by showing every $G_\QQ$-submodule of $A(\QQbar)_\odd$
is a Hecke module and then attacking the non-Eisenstein and Eisenstein
isogenies separately.

    I would like to first and foremost my advisor William Stein for helping me
    through this thesis. I have learned to much by working with him and this
    thesis would not be possible without him.

    Next I would like to thank my officemates in Padelford C-8D for making
    every day of graduate school a experience.
    
    Lastly, I would like to thank my family for their love and support.

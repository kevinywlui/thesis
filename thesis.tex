\abstract{%
In this thesis, we aim to give algorithms for computing two key invariants of
the modular Jacobians $J_0(N)$.

We first give methods for computing the rational torsion order of rank-0
Jacobians $J_0(N)$ that are isogenous to a product of elliptic curves. We call
these the rank-0 totally split Jacobians. The rational torsion is an important
invariant of the Generalized BSD conjecture so being able to compute the
rational torsion order will provide evidence towards this conjecture. We will
provably enumerate the set of totally split $J_0(N)$, give an algorithm for
computing the rational torsion subgroup, and later give techniques for
computing the rational torsion order for rank-0 totally split Jacobians
$J_0(N)$. 

Next we will give an algorithm for computing the rational odd-isogeny class of a
simple abelian subvariety $A$ of $J_0(N)$ for prime $N$, under mild conditions.
In particular, when the Hecke algebra of $A$ is isomorphic to a maximal order
of a number field, we are able to enumerate the odd-isogeny class. This will allow
us to build a table of isogeny graphs of simple abelian subvarieties of
$J_0(N)$.
